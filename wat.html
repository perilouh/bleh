                  <p>ok hai, im ████ but just call me peril. i do mostly frontend dev stuff but ive dipped my toes into python and rust recently and its been cool. i like funky musics (favorites lately being GHOST and pals, tanger, porter robinson, and jamie paige) and purple (i like purple a lot). thats it i think<br>this website has been an on-and-off project of mine since late 2023, im just really indecisive when it comes to web design lol. its good enough for now i guess</p>
